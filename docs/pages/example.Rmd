## Introduction

This is some introductory text. It doesn't have any code chunks, it's just some basic text.

## Some code examples {.tabset}

Here, I'll document how to use some code. For example, getting a bunch of UUIDs and printing them.

### R

```{r}
some_strings <- sapply(
    1:10
    , FUN = function(i){uuid::UUIDgenerate()}
)
for (string in some_strings){
    print(string)
}
```

### Python

```{python}
from uuid import uuid4
some_strings = [
    str(uuid4()) for i in range(9)
]
for string in some_strings:
    print(string)
```

## Other text

This shows you can go back to normal text after the tabs

### No really

This shows you can use a header-3 that doesn't turn into a tab downstream of a tab.
